C#/.Net API and sample program for controlling Honeywell WiFi (and Redlink) thermostats via the 
Total Connect Comfort website. mytotalconnectcomfort.com.

I have used this succesfully with the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostat RTH9580, RTH8580WF and VisionPRO 8000.

Please note you must enter a username, password, location ID, and loaction name into the code to get this to work.

Using this API you can

1. Download all locations for the account.
2. Download all Zones (thermostats) for the a location.
3. Download the Zone information.
4. Control a zone.
